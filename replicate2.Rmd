### Study 2d 
###### Complete (last part failed to replicate)
> In Study 2d, there were 301 participants (mean age = 30.2 years; 120 females, 181 males; median household size = 3 people; median household income = $25,000).

```{r echo=F}
# Read data in
df2d_1 <- read.csv("csv_files/2d_Sheet1.csv", header=T)
df2d_2 <- read.csv("csv_files/2d_Sheet2.csv", header=T)
```

```{r echo=F}
# Number of subjects
df2d_1 %>%
  select(subject) %>%
  summarise(n())

# Mean age

  summarise(mean(age, na.rm=T)) %>%
  round(digits=1)

# Number of females vs. males
df2d_2 %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(n())
```

Attempt to replicate median household size was complex:
```{r}
# Median Household Size
# calculated using income2 : doesn't match
df2d_1 %>%
  summarize(median(inc2, na.rm=T))
# calculated using ses : doesn't match
df2d_1 %>%
  summarize(median(ses, na.rm=T)) %>%
  round(digits=0)
# calculated using income (converted) then inverted : matches!
df2d_1 %>%
  summarize(median(income, na.rm=T))
df2d_1 %>%
  select(inc2) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  arrange(inc2) %>%
  slice(3) # '3' derived from above
# Note above: (technical) I tried to, but couldn't figure out how to use a variable instead of explicitly using the value 3. Again, I suspected the median was taken from the categorized income and then backward matched to its raw value. I suspect this is erroneous and probably due to disregarding the categorical value of 0 is meaningful.
```

> Analyses based on a median split on income replicated earlier results. Higher-income individuals rated the loss gamble as significantly more attractive (M = 11.63, 95% CI = [10.56, 12.69]) than the no-loss gamble (M = 8.33, 95% CI = [7.62, 9.04]), but this difference was smaller for lower-income individuals (loss gamble: M = 10.38, 95% CI = [9.38, 11.38], no-loss gamble: M = 9.18, 95% CI = [8.31, 10.05]).
