# Study 1b - Consistent Valuations Under Scarcity


In Study 1b, there were 151 participants (mean age = 32.9 years; 76 females, 75 males; median household size = 3 people, median household income = $45000).  In Study 1c, there were 604 participants (mean age = 29.9 years; 246 females, 358 males; median household size = 2 people; median household income = $45,000).  Study 1d was conducted with a large, representative sample drawn from Survey Sampling International's panel of U.S respondents.  There were 2,015 participants (mean age = 39.1 years; 1,022 females, 993 males; median household size = 3 people; median household income = $55,000).  In Study 1b, participants read the beer-on-the-beach scenario and indicated their WTP for the beer.  Studies 1c and 1d directly replicated Study 1b.  Because WTP was elicited with an open-ended scale, some participants named unreasonably high prices.  We describe our exclusion rules for these responses in the next section.  These rules were determined before we conducted the significance tests.

In Study 1b, 2 participants were excluded whose Willing-to-pay (WTP) was more than 3 standard deviations from the mean.

Higher-income participants showed the classic effect, offering a higher price for beer from the resort

We replicated the results of 1b with larger samples in studies 1c and 1d.  In study 1c, we excluded 2 participants with missing responses, 5 with unreasonably high WTPs (over $100), and 19 additional outliers on WTP, which left 578 participants.

In Study 1d (the nationally representative sample), a large number of participants reported unreasonably high WTPs, and exclusions based on the rules set for the smaller samples in previous studies would have left many unreasonable prices in the data set.  We therefore included in our analyses only those participants with a WTP of $20 or less, which seemed like the upper bound of a reasonable price.  This set a cutoff price similar to the cutoff price based on the stand deviations in Studies 1b and 1c. After this exclusion and the exclusion of 4 additional participants who were outlines on income, the final sample included 1,898 participants.

The beer-on-the-beach scenario provides a canonical example of the difficulty people have in translating utility into value.  People have a sense of how much they would enjoy the beer, but they have difficulty representing this enjoyment with a price.  However, under conditions of scarcity, people base their price not merely on anticipated enjoyment, but also on anticipated trade-offs, and those are more consistent guides for valuation.  Could scarcity also lead to more consistent baluation of a dollar itself? The next set of studies addressed this question.

#Study 2a - Proportional Versus Trade-Off Thinking

```{r echo = FALSE}

#reads the data for study 2a - spss file, csv file for demographics, and second csv file for income
suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(raw_2a_spss <- read.spss("framing/study_2a.sav", to.data.frame = TRUE)))
suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(raw_2a_csv <- read.csv("study_2a_demog.csv", header = FALSE)))
suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(raw_2a_income_csv <- read.csv("study_2a_income.csv", header = TRUE)))

#average age for Study 2a
raw_2a_csv %>%
  filter(V3 != "NA") %>%
  summarise(mean.age = mean(V3)) %>%
  round(digits = 1)

#calculate sex breakdown for Study 1c
raw_2a_csv %>%
  filter(V4 != 142, V4 != 96) %>%
  group_by(V4) %>%
  summarise(sex_breakdown = n())

#calculate total sample size for Study 1c
raw_2a_csv %>%
  summarise(sample.size = n())

#calculate median household income and size for Study 1c
raw_2a_income_csv %>%
  summarise(median.household.income = median(inc2), median.household.size = median(house))


```

In Study 2a, there were 238 participants ((we are unable to replicate mean age, gender split, median household size, or median household income due to that data not being in the public dataset)) Median ses (which is income / sqrt(householdsize)):

```{r echo = FALSE}
raw_2a_spss %>%
  summarise(sample.size = n(), median.ses = median(ses))

```

***Results***
-------

One participant was excluded as an outlier on income.

```{r echo = FALSE}

clean_2a <- raw_2a_spss %>%
  filter(filter_. != "Not Selected")
```

We conducted binary logistic regressions to comepare the frequency with which participants cited each of the two considerations of interest (trade-offs vs proportional discount) as a function of income.  Higher-income participants were more likely than lower-income participants to use proportional thinking, beta = 0.87, Wald-test chi square (1, N = 237) = 4.02, p < 0.05.

```{r echo = FALSE}

logit3logses <- glm(context ~ lgses, data = clean_2a, family = "binomial")
summary(logit3logses)

wald.test(b = coef(logit3logses), Sigma = vcov(logit3logses), Terms = 2)
```

but lower-income participants were more likely than higher-income participants to use trade-off thinking, beta = -0.96, Wald-test chi square (1, N = 237) = 4.69, p < 0.05.

```{r echo = FALSE}

logit4logses <- glm(tradeoff ~ lgses, data = clean_2a, family = "binomial")
summary(logit4logses)

wald.test(b = coef(logit4logses), Sigma = vcov(logit4logses), Terms = 2)
```

This again suggests that scarcity leads people to generate their own comparison standards, and Studies 2b through 2d tested whether this leads to more consistent preferences.

#Study 2b - Valuing Discounts

In study 2b there were 705 participants (mean age = 30.0 years; 290 females, 415 males; median household size = 3 people; median household income = $45,000).  The participants in Study 2c were the same participants as in Study 1d (and analyses were limited to the same participants, but including all participants did not change the results).  Note that participants completed Studies 1d and 2c in a counterbalanced order.  Participants in Studies 2b and 2c responded to the same scenario as did participants in Study 2a, but they stated whether they would travel for the discount.

***Results***
-------

Confirming earlier findings, these analyses revealed that higher-income participants were more willing to travel when the discount was proportionally larger (i.e., the tablet cost less): Specifically, 86%, 75%, and 58% would travel when the tablet cost $300, $500, and $1,000 respectively.

```{r echo = FALSE}
clean_2b %>%
  filter(split == 1, cond == 0) %>%
  summarise(fivehundred_go = (sum(go) / n()) * 100)

clean_2b %>%
  filter(split == 1, cond == 1) %>%
  summarise(fivehundred_go = (sum(go) / n()) * 100)

clean_2b %>%
  filter(split == 1, cond == 2) %>%
  summarise(onethousand_go = (sum(go) / n()) * 100)

```

Lower-income participants were less sensitive to the proportional size of the discount:  The corresponding percentages of lower-income participants willing to travel were 78%, 67%, and 67%.  

```{r echo = FALSE}
clean_2b %>%
  filter(split == 0, cond == 0) %>%
  summarise(fivehundred_go = (sum(go) / n()) * 100)

clean_2b %>%
  filter(split == 0, cond == 1) %>%
  summarise(fivehundred_go = (sum(go) / n()) * 100)

clean_2b %>%
  filter(split == 0, cond == 2) %>%
  summarise(onethousand_go = (sum(go) / n()) * 100)

```

The ineraction between income and context was significant in a binary logistic regression, beta = -0.048, Walt-test chi square (1, N = 702) = 4.93, p < 0.05,

```{r echo = FALSE}

logit5logses <- glm(go ~ split * cond, data = clean_2b, family = "binomial")
summary(logit5logses)

wald.test(b = coef(logit5logses), Sigma = vcov(logit5logses), Terms = 4)
```

and was marginally significant when income was treated continuously, beta = -0.57, Wald-test chi square(1, N - 702) = 3.32, p < 0.07.

```{r echo = FALSE}

logit6logses <- glm(go ~ logses * cond, data = clean_2b, family = "binomial")
summary(logit6logses)

wald.test(b = coef(logit6logses), Sigma = vcov(logit6logses), Terms = 4)
```

###Study 2c

Five participants were excluded for missing responses in Study 2c, so 1,893 participants were included in the analyses.

```{r echo = FALSE}

setwd("framing")
raw_2c_spss <- read.spss("study_1d.sav", to.data.frame = TRUE)
#reads the data for study 2c

clean_2c <- raw_1d_spss %>%
  filter(filter_. != "Not Selected", go != "NA")
```

Analyses based to a median split on income revealed a more muted trend than in the previous study.  Among higher-income participants, 71%, 67%, and 51% were willing to travel when the tablet cost $300, $500, and $1,000, respectively;

```{r echo = FALSE}
clean_2c %>%
  filter(split == 1, webercond == 0) %>%
  summarise(threehundred_go = (sum(go) / n()) * 100)

clean_2c %>%
  filter(split == 1, webercond == 1) %>%
  summarise(fivehundred_go = (sum(go) / n()) * 100)

clean_2c %>%
  filter(split == 1, webercond == 2) %>%
  summarise(onethousand_go = (sum(go) / n()) * 100)
```

among lower-income participants, the corresponding percentages were 70%, 69%, and 55%.

```{r echo = FALSE}
clean_2c %>%
  filter(split == 0, webercond == 0) %>%
  summarise(threehundred_go = (sum(go) / n()) * 100)

clean_2c %>%
  filter(split == 0, webercond == 1) %>%
  summarise(fivehundred_go = (sum(go) / n()) * 100)

clean_2c %>%
  filter(split == 0, webercond == 2) %>%
  summarise(onethousand_go = (sum(go) / n()) * 100)
```

When income was treated continuously, the interaction between income and context was clear, beta = -0.39, Wald-test chi square(1, N = 1,893) = 6.13, p < 0.05.

```{r echo = FALSE}

logit7logses <- glm(go ~ logses * webercond, data = clean_2c, family = "binomial")
summary(logit7logses)

```
