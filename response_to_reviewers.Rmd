Thank you everyone for the great feedback on our replication-project! There was a lot of encouragement as well as revealing insights as to what our code looks like to people not deeply familiar with our project. 

We cleaned up the code. Deleted many of our misleading notes. Overall there is more consistency and legibility across the file. A bigger undertaking that we couldn't commit would have be to create some kind of dynamic function to auto-generate plots with data germane to each experiment in this paper. That aside, we included more notes revealing our intentions. Finally we replaced many of the ambiguous reference by index-numbers and instead used the variable-names to make the code easier to read. Overall this was a great paper and a tractable regression replication project.  

Best Wishes,
Nick & Aaron
